  <h2> What is NEWS?? </h2>
  <p style="color:red">
      News is information about current events. This may be provided through many different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems,
       broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events.
       Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, 
       economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. 
       Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals,
        have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news,
         which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments,
          often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can
           spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with
            the newspaper, which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with paper and printing press, 
            to Europe.

<h3>Etymology</h3>
            <p>

The English word "news" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of "new".
 In Middle English, the equivalent word was newes, like the French nouvelles and the German Neues.
  Similar developments are found in the Slavic languages the Czech and Slovak noviny (from nový, "new"), 
  the cognate Polish nowiny, the Bulgarian novini, and Russian novosti – and in the Celtic languages: 
  the Welsh newyddion (from newydd) and the Cornish nowodhow (from nowydh).[1][2]Jessica Garretson Finch is
  credited with coining the phrase "current events" while teaching at Barnard College in the 1890s.[3]

  <h3>Newness</h3>

<p>

As its name implies, "news" typically connotes the presentation of new information.[4][5]
 The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful 
 investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.[5][6][7] Whereas historians tend to view events as 
 causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation,
  and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.[8] News conspicuously describes the world in
   the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in
    the past—or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some "peg",
     an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.[8][9] Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of
      reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.[10] Hence the famous dictum that "Dog Bites Man"
       is not news, but "Man Bites Dog" is.[11]

Another corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news
 more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.[12]
  </p>
  <h3>Commodity</h3>
  <p>
      According to some theories, "news" is whatever the news industry sells.[13] Journalism,
      broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.
      [14][15] From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server)
       necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.[16] A news agency supplies this resource "wholesale" 
       and publishers enhance it for retail.[17][18]
